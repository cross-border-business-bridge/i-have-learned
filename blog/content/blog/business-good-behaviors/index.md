## Business exploration 
### Know your customer 
+ Explore client's needs by communication, ask question in guidance
+ What's his trouble or headache, how does your product or service support
+ design your questions, explore on both man and their business.

### Pre sale
+ Show how about our products can solve their business headaches
+ Be confident to the queries, also be honest regarding the product's quality.   

### Make a deal   
+ Not every pre-sale can generate a deal finally, keep patient, contact with your counter-part continually for possible business break-through. 

+ If failed this time, please still keep patient, wait the 2nd or 3rd deal.
