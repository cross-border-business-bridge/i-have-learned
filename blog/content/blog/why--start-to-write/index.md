# What I have learned  

## Why write it
1. Mainly record my best practices which I have learnt, I hope these rules will benefit to both you and me.  

2. Review these rules constantly to avoid the same mistake again. 


## Disclaimer
This disclaimer informs readers that the views, thoughts, and opinions expressed in the text belong solely to the author, and not necessarily to the authorâ€™s employer, organization, committee or other group or individual.

## Motivation 
Inspired by JSConf speaker Gao (https://github.com/wgao19), document writing is an interesting way to clean up your thoughts. 

1. Anyway you need to upgrade yourself to the next level, whether for your career building or personal interest. 

2. The new ideas will always come from training and book reading, just write them down for some key points, what you are benefit from.

3. Share your best practice will make your strong. 

4. Use English as much as possible.
