Suggestion: Getting China to buy in early and feel accommodated will remove some of the incentives for it to create Chinese alternatives (a venture that is quite expensive and wouldnâ€™t make sense absent a pressing strategic need).

My thoughts:
Provide back-route to your competition counterpart, not best, but can survive.
