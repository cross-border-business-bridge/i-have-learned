### Calm down!
Don't rush down for your payment. Pay attention to your payment and payment card. Please always ask these questions to yourself. 
```$xslt
1. When to pay, pay now or later? Always calm your desire to do payment, calm down. Remember that you are not VIP after payment process.  
2. How much to pay? 
3. Check the receipt carefully. 
4. Hide your bank card always, only show it when needed.   
```


### Why receipt? 
Consider things completely, try to protect yourself.
```$xslt
1. Any purchase or payment, request for the receipt always. Prepare for future possible conflict, the law only recognize evidence, but not your words. 
2. Refrain yourself to make decision on bad status. if you don't feel good at that moment, try to keep silent, walk around...
