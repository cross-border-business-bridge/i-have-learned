### When invited to a party or meet-up 
1. Control your talk willingness & initialization, listen more. 

2. Don't blame others who are not presented here, you should not critisize anyone.  

3. Always make your brain clearly to avoid any bad words.

4. Do some preparation before the party, for example try to remember the clients' name.

### 聆听的级别
+ 耐心地听，使用肢体语言鼓励对方多表达, 控制自己说话的冲动，除非对方暗示你需要做一些回应。 
+ 站在自己的角度思考对方说话的意图。
+ 站在对方的角度揣摩对方说话的意图，和珅之于乾隆，善解人意。
