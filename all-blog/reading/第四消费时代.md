## My thoughts
1. Japan's development is the mirror of China. With the prosperity of great economy grow, many people move to big cities to seek for good job; Now the economy becomes more steady or depressed, plus more older people in the society, this is current situation, how to find new business?  How to change your business to attract them again?

2. Notes picked from the book
    ```bash
    第三消费社会之前的人类以“物”为焦点，而在第四消费社会中人类以“人”为焦点。对于人类来说重要的不是消费了什么，而是和什么人一起做了什么。
    ```

3. Business insights 
   
   + A place where is convenient to call people in, interesting topics and activities to attract their appetite to join in.
