## Motivation 
Inspired by JSConf speaker Gao (https://github.com/wgao19), document writing is an interesting way to clean up your thoughts. 

1. Anyway you need to upgrade yourself to the next level, whether for your career building or personal interest. 

2. The new ideas will always come from training and book reading, just write them down for some key points, what you are benifit from.

3. Share your best practice will make your strong. 

4. Use English as much as possible.
